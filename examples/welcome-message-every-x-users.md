# Welcome Message every X users

This example will show how to keep an array/object of new users coming into a server. Then, when this array reaches a certain number of users, it shows a message welcoming those users as a group. When your server becomes popular and you get dozens of users every day, you will find this to be much less annoying than welcoming one user at a time!

The events we're going to use in this example:

* `guildMemberAdd` , which triggers when a new user joins the server.
* `guildMemberRemove` , which triggers when a user leaves the server.

Also, we're going to be using a `Discord.Collection()` object to save the users. Why? Because it's available, has great helper methods, and is _built_ to support the Discord.js objects we're putting in it!

Initializing the discord collection is simple: `const newUsers = new Discord.Collection();` . This has to be done _outside_ of the events we're going to use. I have it at the top of my file, _after_ the `const Discord = require('discord.js')` line, obviously.

Adding new members that join to the collection is simple:

```javascript
client.on("guildMemberAdd", (member) => {
  newUsers.set(member.id, member.user);
});
```

If a user leaves while he's on that list though, it would cause your bot to welcome @invalid-user. To fix this, we remove that user from the collection:

```javascript
client.on("guildMemberRemove", (member) => {
  if(newUsers.has(member.id)) newUsers.delete(member.id);
});
```

But wait, where do we welcome users? That's done in `guildMemberAdd`, when the count reaches the number you want:

```javascript
client.on("guildMemberAdd", (member) => {
  const guild = member.guild;
  newUsers.set(member.id, member.user);

  if (newUsers.size > 10) {
    const defaultChannel = guild.channels.find(c=> c.permissionsFor(guild.me).has("SEND_MESSAGES"));
    const userlist = newUsers.map(u => u.toString()).join(" ");
    defaultChannel.send("Welcome our new users!\n" + userlist);
    newUsers.clear();
  }
});
```

Two lines require a little more explanation:

* `newUsers.map(u => u.toString()).join(" ");` uses the fancy ES6 `map` function to get a mention for each user in the array, then joins them with a space between each.
* `newUsers.clear()` _resets_ empties the cache completely, so it resets to 0.

## Multiple servers

The only issue with the above code is that it would only work if your bot is on a single server. Though this might be alright you, there's a chance you want to support multiple servers. How do we do that? We change `newUsers` to an `Array` instead, and each server gets its own cache. Here is a **complete** example that does nothing but welcome new users:

```javascript
const Discord = require("discord.js");
const client = new Discord.Client();

const newUsers = [];

client.on("ready", () => {
  console.log("I am ready!");
});

client.on("message", (message) => {
  if (message.content.startsWith("ping")) {
    message.channel.send("pong!");
  }
});

client.on("guildMemberAdd", (member) => {
  const guild = member.guild;
  if (!newUsers[guild.id]) newUsers[guild.id] = new Discord.Collection();
  newUsers[guild.id].set(member.id, member.user);

  if (newUsers[guild.id].size > 10) {
    const userlist = newUsers[guild.id].map(u => u.toString()).join(" ");
    guild.channels.find("name", "general").send("Welcome our new users!\n" + userlist);
    newUsers[guild.id].clear();
  }
});

client.on("guildMemberRemove", (member) => {
  const guild = member.guild;
  if (newUsers[guild.id].has(member.id)) newUsers.delete(member.id);
});

client.login("SuperSecretBotTokenHere");
```
